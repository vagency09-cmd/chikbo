# Chikbo API Contract (v1)

Base URL: `http://localhost:4000/api/v1` (env-configurable per client).
All responses use the envelope `{ success: true, data }` or `{ success: false, error: { code, message, details? } }`.
All money values are **integer paise** (₹1 = 100). Use `formatPaise` from `@chikbo/shared`.
Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`. Refresh with the refresh token; access tokens last 15 min.
Shared TypeScript types live in `packages/shared/src/index.ts` (`@chikbo/shared`) — use them.

## Auth
| Method | Path | Body | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | /auth/register | `{email, password, name, phone?}` | → `{user, accessToken, refreshToken}` (201) |
| POST | /auth/login | `{email, password}` | → `{user, accessToken, refreshToken}` |
| POST | /auth/refresh | `{refreshToken}` | → `{accessToken, refreshToken}` (rotates; store the new one) |
| POST | /auth/logout | `{refreshToken}` | revokes it |
| GET | /auth/providers | — | → `{google:{enabled, clientId}}` — clients render the Google button only when `enabled` |
| POST | /auth/google | `{idToken}` | Google ID token from Google Identity Services → `{user, accessToken, refreshToken}`. Verified server-side against Google's public keys; only ever creates a CUSTOMER |
| POST | /auth/forgot-password | `{email}` | Always → `{sent:true}` (never reveals whether an address is registered). Emails a single-use link valid 60 min |
| POST | /auth/reset-password | `{token, newPassword}` | Consumes the token, sets the password, revokes every session |
| POST | /auth/change-password | `{currentPassword, newPassword}` | auth required; revokes all sessions |
| GET | /auth/me | — | → `{id, email, name, role, permissions}` |

Password rule: ≥8 chars with a letter and a number. Phone: 10-digit Indian mobile.

## Profile & addresses (auth)
- `PATCH /users/me` `{name?, phone?}`
- `GET /users/me/addresses` → `AddressDto[]`
- `POST /users/me/addresses` (AddressDto fields minus id; `pincode` 6 digits) — first address becomes default
- `PATCH /users/me/addresses/:id`, `DELETE /users/me/addresses/:id`
- `POST /users/me/device-tokens` `{token, platform: 'ios'|'android'|'web'}` — push registration
- `GET /users/me/notifications` → in-app notifications (latest 50)

## Catalog (public)
- `GET /catalog/categories` → `CategoryDto[]` tree (top level: sarees, dresses, tops, bottomwear, antique-imitation-jewellery)
- `GET /catalog/products?page&pageSize&category=<slug>&search&minPrice&maxPrice&sizes=S,M&colors=Ivory&inStock=true&sort=newest|price_asc|price_desc|rating`
  → `Paginated<ProductListItemDto>`. minPrice/maxPrice are **rupees**.
- `GET /catalog/products/:slug` → `ProductDetailDto` (includes `variants` with per-variant price/discount/stock)
- `GET /catalog/products/:slug/reviews?page&pageSize` → `Paginated<ReviewDto>`
- `GET /catalog/home` → `HomeSectionDto[]` — the merchandised homepage: active sections inside
  their schedule window, ordered by `sortOrder`, each with its **active** items ordered by
  `sortOrder`. `PRODUCT_CAROUSEL` sections arrive with `products: ProductListItemDto[]` already
  resolved from their `config` (`{source: 'newest'|'category'|'manual', categorySlug?, productIds?, limit?}`);
  every other type has `products: []`. Section/item shapes live in `@chikbo/shared`
  (`HomeSectionDto`, `HomeSectionItemDto`, `HOME_SECTION_TYPES`). No auth, cacheable.
- `GET /catalog/serviceability?pincode=500002` → `ServiceabilityDto`
  `{pincode, serviceable, etaDays, codAvailable: false, message}`. Pincode is 6 digits and cannot
  start with 0. Backed by Shiprocket courier serviceability when configured, otherwise a pan-India
  default (≈5 days); answers are cached in-process for 24h. **COD is always false** — Chikbo is prepaid only.

`ProductListItemDto` carries `badge` (`"New"`, `"Bestseller"`, …) for the card's bottom-left flag.

## Guest sessions
Browsing, the cart and checkout never require an account. A client that has no
session identifies itself with an `X-Guest-Token` header: an opaque, URL-safe
string of 16–128 chars it generates once and keeps (the web app stores a UUID
in localStorage). A signed-in request ignores the header. After sign-in or
registration the client calls `POST /orders/claim` to hand the guest session
over to the account.

## Cart (guest or auth)
- `GET /cart?coupon=CODE&email=` → `CartDto` (server prices everything; passing `coupon` validates & prices it — 422 with codes `COUPON_INVALID|COUPON_EXPIRED|COUPON_MIN_ORDER|COUPON_EXHAUSTED|COUPON_ALREADY_USED` when not applicable). Guests may pass the `email` they will check out with so the per-customer coupon limit is checked early.
- `POST /cart/items` `{variantId, qty}` → CartDto (max 10/line, clamped to stock)
- `PATCH /cart/items/:id` `{qty}` (0 removes) → CartDto
- `DELETE /cart/items/:id` → CartDto
- `POST /cart/merge` (auth) `{guestToken}` → `{merged, cart}` — folds a guest cart into the account cart (quantities add up). `POST /orders/claim` does this too.

Shipping: free at/above ₹999 after discount, else ₹79 (constants in shared).

## Wishlist (auth)
- `GET /wishlist`, `POST /wishlist/:productId`, `DELETE /wishlist/:productId`

## Checkout & payment (guest or auth)
1. `POST /checkout` → `CheckoutCreateResponse` `{orderId, orderNumber, razorpayOrderId, razorpayKeyId, amountInPaise, currency, prefill}`. Keep the same idempotencyKey when retrying — the same pending order is returned.
   - Signed in: `{addressId, couponCode?, idempotencyKey: <uuid>}` (a saved address), or an inline `address` instead of `addressId`.
   - Guest (`X-Guest-Token`): `{email, address: {fullName, phone, line1, line2?, city, state, pincode}, couponCode?, idempotencyKey}`. The confirmation email goes to `email`; the order carries no user until it is claimed.
   Errors: 422 `INSUFFICIENT_STOCK`, `PAYMENTS_UNAVAILABLE`, `NOT_SERVICEABLE` (no courier delivers to the address pincode), coupon codes above.
2. Open Razorpay Checkout with `key: razorpayKeyId, order_id: razorpayOrderId, amount, currency`.
3. On success: `POST /payments/verify` with `{razorpay_order_id, razorpay_payment_id, razorpay_signature}` → `{orderId, orderNumber, status}`.
4. On failure/dismiss: `POST /payments/failed` `{razorpay_order_id, error_code?, error_description?}`.
   The server also confirms via webhook, so verify failure is non-fatal; poll the order.
   Both endpoints accept a guest token in place of a session; `verify` only confirms an order the caller placed.

## Guest orders → account
- `GET /orders/guest/:id` (`X-Guest-Token`) → `OrderDto` — the order-success page reads the order it just placed.
- `POST /orders/claim` (auth) `{guestToken}` → `{claimedOrders, mergedCartLines}` — every unclaimed order placed with that token becomes the account's (coupon redemptions follow), and the guest cart merges into the account cart. Idempotent. The web app calls this right after any sign-in or registration and then rotates its guest token.

## Orders (auth)
- `GET /orders?page&pageSize` → `Paginated<OrderDto>`
- `GET /orders/:id` → `OrderDto` (includes `trackingEvents` when shipped)
- `POST /orders/:id/cancel` `{reason}` — allowed in PENDING/CONFIRMED/PROCESSING; auto-refunds if paid
- `POST /orders/:id/return` `{orderItemId, reason (≥10 chars), imageUrls: [≥1 photo]}` — only for DELIVERED (genuine damage policy)
- `GET /orders/returns` → my return requests

Order statuses: PENDING, CONFIRMED, PROCESSING, SHIPPED, OUT_FOR_DELIVERY, DELIVERED, CANCELLED, RETURN_REQUESTED, RETURNED, REFUND_INITIATED, REFUNDED.

## Reviews (auth)
- `POST /reviews` `{productId, rating 1-5, title?, body?}` (upserts own review; verifiedPurchase auto-set)
- `DELETE /reviews/:id`

## Redirects (public)
- `GET /seo/redirect?path=/p/old-slug` → `{destination, statusCode}` or `{destination: null}`. Admin redirects, including the automatic ones recorded when a product or category slug changes, follow short chains. The storefront calls this when a product, category or route is not found and replaces the URL.

## Uploads (auth)
- `POST /uploads` multipart field `files` (≤6 files; images jpeg/png/webp/avif ≤5MB, videos mp4/webm/mov ≤100MB) → `[{url, size, kind: 'image'|'video'}]`. URLs are server-relative (`/uploads/...`) — prefix with the API origin when rendering — or absolute when `R2_PUBLIC_URL` is set.
- `POST /uploads/from-url` `{url}` → `{url, size}` — downloads and stores the image rather than hot-linking it. Slow or failing sources return 422 `IMPORT_TIMEOUT` or 400 with a readable message.
- Storage: Cloudflare R2, bucket key `uploads/<file>`. Images are auto-rotated, scaled to fit 2000px and re-encoded as WebP; videos are stored as uploaded after a container-signature check. Without R2 credentials (local dev) images fall back to Postgres (`StoredImage`) and videos are refused with 422 `STORAGE_UNAVAILABLE`.
- `GET /uploads/<path>` serves from R2 first, then repo-committed files, then Postgres, with a one-year immutable cache header and byte-range support (206) for video seeking.
- `scripts/migrate-uploads-to-r2.ts` copies repo-committed and database images into R2; safe to re-run.

## Admin (auth + STAFF/SUPER_ADMIN + RBAC permission)
All under `/admin`. 403 body includes the missing permission.
- `GET /admin/dashboard` (dashboard.view) → `{ordersToday, revenueTodayInPaise, revenueMonthInPaise, pendingShipments, openReturns, lowStockCount, customers, recentOrders}`
- `GET /admin/reports/sales?days=30` (reports.read) → `{daily[], bestSellers[], byCategory[]}`
- Categories: `GET/POST /admin/categories`, `PATCH/DELETE /admin/categories/:id` (products.read / categories.write)
  - `sizeType` (`clothing` | `waist` | `footwear` | `kids` | `free` | `none`, nullable): the size chart the admin product form offers for this category. Null inherits the parent category's, else `clothing`. Charts live in `SIZE_CHARTS` (`@chikbo/shared`).
- Products: `GET /admin/products?page&search&categoryId`, `POST /admin/products` (name, slug, description, categoryId, attributes?, badge?, images[{url, alt?, color?}], variants[{sku, size?, color?, weightGrams?, priceInPaise, discountPriceInPaise?, stockQty, lowStockThreshold?}]) — `images[].color` names the variant colour a photo shows (null = every colour); the storefront gallery, bag and order thumbnails pick photos by the chosen colour, `PATCH /admin/products/:id` (same fields incl. `badge`), `DELETE /admin/products/:id` (only for products never ordered — 409 otherwise; hide with `isActive:false` instead), `POST /admin/products/:id/variants`, `PATCH /admin/variants/:id` (stock changes go through inventory adjust, not variant patch)
- Inventory: `GET /admin/inventory/low-stock`, `POST /admin/inventory/adjust` `{variantId, delta, reason: MANUAL_ADJUSTMENT|RESTOCK|CORRECTION|RETURN_RECEIVED, note?}`, `GET /admin/inventory/history/:variantId`
- Orders: `GET /admin/orders?page&status&search&from&to`, `GET /admin/orders/:id` (full detail incl. payments, shipments, history), `POST /admin/orders/:id/status` `{status: PROCESSING|SHIPPED|OUT_FOR_DELIVERY|DELIVERED|CANCELLED, note?}` → the order plus `refundError` (string when a cancelled paid order's automatic refund could not start; the cancellation still stands — retry with the refund endpoint)
- Shipments: `POST /admin/orders/:id/shipment` (creates in Shiprocket; 422 `SHIPPING_UNAVAILABLE` when Shiprocket credentials are not set), `POST /admin/shipments/:id/awb` `{courierId?}`, `GET /admin/shipments`
- Returns: `GET /admin/returns?status`, `POST /admin/returns/:id/decision` `{decision: APPROVED|REJECTED, adminNote?}`, `POST /admin/returns/:id/received` `{restock}`
- Refunds: `POST /admin/orders/:id/refund` `{amountInPaise?, reason, returnRequestId?}`
- Payments: `GET /admin/payments?status`
- Customers: `GET /admin/customers?search`, `GET /admin/customers/:id`, `PATCH /admin/customers/:id` `{isActive}`
- Coupons: `GET/POST /admin/coupons`, `PATCH /admin/coupons/:id` — PERCENT value is basis points (1000 = 10%), FLAT value is paise
- Staff: `GET /admin/roles` → `{roles, allPermissions}`, `POST/PATCH /admin/roles(/:id)`, `GET/POST /admin/staff`, `PATCH /admin/staff/:id` `{staffRoleId?, isActive?}`
- Homepage CMS (`content.read` to read, `content.write` to change) — all return `AdminHomeSectionDto`
  (the public shape minus `products`) or `HomeSectionItemDto`:
  - `GET /admin/home-sections` → every section, **including inactive and out-of-schedule ones**, with all items
  - `POST /admin/home-sections` `{type, title?, subtitle?, isActive?, sortOrder?, config?, startsAt?, endsAt?}` — appended to the bottom when `sortOrder` is omitted
  - `PATCH /admin/home-sections/:id` (same fields, all optional), `DELETE /admin/home-sections/:id` (items cascade)
  - `POST /admin/home-sections/reorder` `{ids: string[]}` → the re-sorted list (`sortOrder` becomes the array index)
  - `POST /admin/home-sections/:id/items` `{imageUrl?, mobileImageUrl?, title?, subtitle?, ctaLabel?, href?, isActive?, sortOrder?}`
  - `POST /admin/home-sections/:id/items/reorder` `{ids: string[]}` → the re-sorted items
  - `PATCH /admin/home-section-items/:id`, `DELETE /admin/home-section-items/:id`
  - Images go through `POST /uploads`; `href` takes `/c/<slug>`, `/p/<slug>` or an absolute URL.
  - `endsAt` must be after `startsAt` (400 `BAD_REQUEST` otherwise). Every write lands in the audit log.

Demo credentials after seeding: `admin@chikbo.in` / `ChangeMe@123` (SUPER_ADMIN), `ops@chikbo.in` / `ChangeMe@123` (Operations Manager).
